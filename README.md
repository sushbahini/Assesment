# Assesment

Task1: Download and prepare data from the Gazette REST API  

1 -- Notice feed entries for 2443 notices in the month of January 2021.
I have completed the task. Please find the code and the output file attached.

2 -- The text content of all 2901 notices (Change of Name) from 01/01/2020 to 31/03/2020 
I have obtained only the notice feed for all 2901 notices. 

3 -- I did not find the company numbers mentioned. 

4 -- The notice feed items from Corporate Insolvency notices (specifically 2432, 2431, 2433, 2443, 2441) for the full month of March for years 2015-2020.
I have obtained only 30-40% of the data. Because it was time consuming.

===============================================================================

Task2:Prepare some analysis and visualisation of the data previously downloaded or provided

1-- Are there any year-on-year patterns in the corporate insolvency dataset?
Are there trends or are some of the notice codes placed significantly more often?

I have used Tableau for creating the visual. I have used line graph to identify the trend. 
As per my observation, in 2017 least number of notices were published. 

2 -- Can you extract the old name and the new name from the 2901 dataset by using string methods or regex patterns or by utilising an NLP library (such as spaCy)?

I did not attempt this.
